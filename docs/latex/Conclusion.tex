\chapter{Conclusion}

This document has covered the design and implementation of a typical feed handler in C or C++ using the
Kx C API. We have demonstrated the basics of how to communicate with kdb+ using handles and K objects,
using threads to perform work in the background and pushing data from a background thread to the main
q thread so updates can be performed.
