\chapter{Conclusion}

This document has covered the design and implementation of a typical feed handler in C or C++ using the
Kx C API. We have demonstrated the basics of how to communicate with kdb+ using handles and K objects,
using threads to perform work in the background and pushing data from a background thread to the main
q thread so updates can be performed. We have also produced sample code that replicated a real world feed
handlers API and created a feed handler that parses the generated data, converts it to a K object and pushes
it to the main thread of the q process.
